* TODO category theory

** small category

	 small category is a category such that all of its objects form a set and all of its morphisms form a set.

* tranditional abstract algebra

** group by category

	 The group axioms can be formed by category thinking, that's a small-category that
	 
	 1. only has one object
	 2. all morphisms are isomorphisms

	 In this situtation, we have the following mapping

  | category ℭ     | corrresponding group G |
  |----------------+------------------------|
  | morphisms in ℭ | elements of G          |
  | ○ in ℭ         | ⋅ in G                 |
  | 1ℭ             | e ∈ G                  |

	 A more advanced idea is, viewing group as a list of operations (partially applied ~⋅ a~), with e as initial state

	 Then the category diagram will just reflect the idea
