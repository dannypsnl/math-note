* category theory

** small category

	 small category is a category such that all of its objects form a set and all of its morphisms form a set.

** product category

	 For any two categories 𝒜, ℬ, we can build a product of them as a category, write as 𝒜×ℬ

	 𝒪𝒷(𝒜×ℬ) = 𝒪𝒷(𝒜) × 𝒪𝒷(ℬ)
	 (𝒜×ℬ)((A, B), (A', B')) = 𝒜(A, A') × ℬ(B, B')

	 As well, we define ∘ as

	 (f, g) ∘ (h, j) = (f∘h, g∘j)

	 and define identity of (A, B) as

	 1(A, B) = (1A, 1B)
	
* tranditional abstract algebra

** group by category

	 The group axioms can be formed by category thinking, that's a small-category that
	 
	 1. only has one object
	 2. all morphisms are isomorphisms

	 In this situtation, we have the following mapping

  | category ℭ     | corrresponding group G |
  |----------------+------------------------|
  | morphisms in ℭ | elements of G          |
  | ○ in ℭ         | ⋅ in G                 |
  | 1ℭ             | e ∈ G                  |

	 A more advanced idea is, viewing group as a list of operations (partially applied ~⋅ a~), with e as initial state

	 Then the category diagram will just reflect the idea

* Functor

	A functor ~F : 𝒜 → ℬ~ consists

	1. function makes 𝒪𝒷(𝒜) to 𝒪𝒷(ℬ), write as A ⟶  F(A)
	2. for every morphism ~f : A → A'~ in 𝒜, makes corrresponding morphism in ℬ, write as f ⟶  F(f)
	3. composition of morphism are preserved
	4. identities are preserved

** Free functor (informal term)

	Given any set ~S~, one can build the *free group* ~F(S)~ on ~S~. For example, said ~S = {x, y, z}~, insert ~e~, ~x⁻¹~, ~y⁻¹~, ~z⁻¹~ makes a group (informally). Just like we have in mind, ~x ⋅ x⁻¹ = e~, and so on. This group is the *free group* of ~{x, y, z}~. On the other hand, this ~F~ became a functor, from *Set* to *Grp*. Maps of sets ~S~, ~S'~, rise to a homomorphism of groups.

	The same can be done for *Set* to *Vectₖ*, *Set* to *CRing*, and many. Such thing is what we called free functor, informally.
