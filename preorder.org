* preorder 預序

	A preorder is a relation on set X, such that, two elements of x, y ∈ X we can discuss x ≤ y.

** poset (powerset)

	*poset* is an interesting instance, its the preorder free from a powerset of any set X

	The ⊆ is the ≤ here, for any two elements of powerset a, b ∈ P(X)
	
	- a ⋃ b is a ∨ b
	- a ⋂ b is a ∧ b

** upper/lower bound

	 The definition of upper bound is,

	 - set X
	 - A ⊆ X

	 An element x ∈ X is an upper bound of A, iff ∀ a ∈ A, a ≤ x

	 Reversely, x ∈ X is a lower bound of A, iff ∀ a ∈ A, x ≤ a
