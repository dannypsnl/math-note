* preorder 預序

	A preorder is a relation on set X, such that, two elements of x, y ∈ X we can discuss x ≤ y.

** poset (powerset)

	*poset* is an interesting instance, its the preorder free from a powerset of any set X

	The ⊆ is the ≤ here, for any two elements of powerset a, b ∈ P(X)
	
	- a ⋃ b is a ∨ b
	- a ⋂ b is a ∧ b
