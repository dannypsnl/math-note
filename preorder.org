* preorder 預序

	A preorder is a relation on set X, such that, two elements of x, y ∈ X we can discuss x ≤ y.
 
	The following definition are quite important for preorder, we will assume

	- set X
	- A ⊆ X 

** upper/lower bound

	 An element x ∈ X is an upper bound of A, iff ∀ a ∈ A, a ≤ x

	 Reversely, x ∈ X is a lower bound of A, iff ∀ a ∈ A, x ≤ a

** greatest/least element

	 An upper bound x of A is the greatest element iff x ∈ A

	 Reversely, lower bound x of A is the least element iff x ∈ A

** maximal/minimal

	 An element a ∈ A is maximal, if ∀ b, a ≤ b implies a ≅ b

	 Reversely, a ∈ A is minimal, if ∀ b, b ≤ a implies b ≅ a

** join/meet

	 A join of A is that, a least element of the set of upper bounds for A (called least upper bound or supremum, sometimes)

	 A meet of A is, a greatest element of the set of lower bounds for A (called greatest lower bound or infimum, sometimes)

	 1. The syntax ∨A is a choice of one of the joins of A
	 2. The syntax ∧A is a choice of one of the meets of A
	 3. ∀ x ∈ X, ∨A ≤ x ⟹ A ≤ x
	 4. ∀ x ∈ X, x ≤ ∧A ⟹ x ≤ A

*** singleton has only one meet/join

		∨{x} = ∧{x} = x

*** empty set 

		The ∨∅ called ⊥, if it existed, ⊥ ≤ x

		The ∧∅ called ⊤, if it existed, x ≤ ⊤

* poset (preoder free from powerset)

	*poset* is an interesting instance, its the preorder free from a powerset of any set X

	The ⊆ is the ≤ here, for any two elements of powerset a, b ∈ P(X)
	
	- a ⋃ b is a ∨ b
	- a ⋂ b is a ∧ b
