* dependent type

	+ In STΛC, terms depend on terms
	+ In dependent type theory, not only terms, but types can depend on terms.
	+ ~n : ℕ ⊢ isEven(n)~

	Rules are similar as STΛC, but formation (construct types) now also has context

	+ Λ-form now is

		Γ ⊢ P : Type, Γ ⊢ Q : Type
		--------------------------
		      Γ ⊢ P ∧ Q

	+ for now, type is proposition, program, sets
