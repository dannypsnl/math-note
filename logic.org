** M₀ minimal logic

** J₀ intuitionistic logic

** K₀ classical logic

* Derivation

	 The definition is a formula ~C~ is /derivable/ in calculi M₀, J₀, or K₀ from a set Γ of assumptions.

	 1. assumptions Γ are a finite sequence of formulas A₁, ..., Aₙ
	 2. for each 1 ≤ i ≤ n, Aᵢ is one of
			1. axiom of calculi
			2. formula
			3. can be obtained by modus ponens from several Aⱼ (where j < i)
	 3. Aₙ = C (the final formula is the target)

	 We say that A₁, ..., Aₙ is a /derivation/ of C

	 We can write Γ ⊢ C

** Proposition 1

	 If Γ ⊢ B and Δ ⊢ B ⥰ C, then Γ⋃Δ ⊢ C

	 1. By definition, Γ has final assumption Bₙ = B
	 2. Δ has final assumption Cₘ = B ⥰ C
	 3. Thus, Γ⋃Δ has enough information to produce C, by Bₙ is B and Cₘ is B ⥰ C
